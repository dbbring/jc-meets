# Meets App Front End

## {Step One} Install Dependencies

Navigate to the jc-meets/meets-app folder. In other words, where you are currently... ;).
Then simply run:

```
npm install
```

Node package manager should download the required production and developmental libraries. I used vue-cli to generate this front end, so there are quite a few dev dependencies.

## {Step Two} Serve It Up

To run this locally, simply stay in the current folder (../jc-meets/meets-app) and run:

```
npm run dev
```

Provided there are no webpack issues, you should see the modules loading and soon your project will be available on localhost port 8080.

## {Step Three} View the Project

First off, please make sure the backend API is running in a seperate command terminal. Please see the Main docs, or the API docs to get the Flask-RESTful API running.

Finally, visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the project.
